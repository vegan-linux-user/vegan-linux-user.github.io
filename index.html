            <h3>Metroid Remake</h3>
            <p>I developed a remake of Metroid using Unity and C#. In this project, I focused on creating seamless player movement and animations, implementing sound design, and designing levels that provide an engaging user experience.</p>
            <p>Some of the features I worked on include a health system, knockback and damage interactions, player invincibility frames, and powerups/collectables. I also implemented doors and room transitions, camera following and bounding, and a custom magnet beam mechanic using Unity/C# features like coroutines and the singleton design pattern.</p>

            <h3>Note Goats</h3>
            <p>Note Goats is a 2-player rhythm party game where your goal is to collect as many carrots as possible while avoiding the rhythmic hazards. I developed this game solo in unity.</p>

            <h3>Drawn Together</h3>
            <p>Drawn Together is a 3D puzzle platformer where the drawings Skrib and Sketch have come to life and are looking to restore their tattered storybook. With Skrib's sheild and Sketch's copter, you must work together to solve puzzles and find their missing pages.</p>
            <p>I worked on almost every aspect of this game, whether it was character abilities, modeling, level design, UI, etc. My biggest contributions would be the development of the split screen and cinematic cameras, the entire tutorial level design, and character abilities. Additionally, I created the trailer for the game.</p>
